## Introduction
Pneumonia is a severe respiratory infection that affects the lungs. Early detection of pneumonia through chest X-ray images is crucial for timely treatment. This project explores the implementation of a machine learning model using the VGG16 architecture to classify chest X-ray images into pneumonia and normal categories.

## Motivation
Early detection of pneumonia can significantly impact patient outcomes and reduce the burden on healthcare systems. This project aims to showcase the potential of machine learning in medical image classification and its relevance in real-world healthcare scenarios.

## Implementation
The project utilizes the VGG16 pre-trained model for transfer learning. The implementation includes data processing, model training, evaluation, and predictions. The code is written in Python and executed in Google Colab.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). It consists of chest X-ray images categorized into pneumonia and normal cases. The dataset is organized into train, test, and validation sets.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Mount Google Drive:**
   Make sure you have the dataset and necessary files uploaded to your Google Drive. Run the following code in Google Colab to mount your Google Drive and access the files:

   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

2. **Set Working Directory:**
   Set your working directory to the folder containing your project files using the following code. Replace `'/content/drive/My Drive/Chest_xray2'` with the correct path to your project folder.

   ```python
   os.chdir('/content/drive/My Drive/Chest_xray2')
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**
   Ensure you have all the required Python packages installed. If you haven't already installed the necessary packages, you can create a `requirements.txt` file with the required packages and run the following command in a code cell:

   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   Open and run the Jupyter Notebook file `Chest_Xray_Image_Classification.ipynb` in Google Colab. The notebook contains all the code for data processing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.

5. **Follow Notebook Instructions:**
   Inside the notebook, follow the instructions provided in markdown cells and code comments. Pay attention to the comments explaining each code block, and execute the cells sequentially.

6. **Note on Saved Model:**
   The model will be saved to your Google Drive at the end of the notebook execution. You can load this saved model for making predictions in the future. The saved model file will be named `my_model.h5` and will be located in the same directory where your notebook is running.

7. **Predictions:**
   After training the model, you can use the `predict(img_name)` function to make predictions on individual chest X-ray images. Provide the path to the image file as the argument to the `predict()` function. For example:

   ```python
   predict('/content/drive/My Drive/Chest_xray2/train/PNEUMONIA/person7_bacteria_29.jpeg')
   ```

   This function will display the image and print the predicted diagnosis (Normal or Pneumonia).

8. **Review Predictions:**
   The notebook also contains code for displaying predictions on validation and test images. You can review the model's performance on these images by running the corresponding code cells.

9. **Future Tasks:**
   The notebook suggests future tasks related to image distribution correction, creating a confusion matrix, and looking for the F1 score. You can explore these tasks for further analysis and improvement.

Make sure to adapt the file paths and folder names in the code according to your specific project structure. Also, ensure that the necessary dataset files are available in the specified directories.

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Chest_Xray_Image_Classification.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Follow the code cells sequentially to understand data processing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
3. Modify hyperparameters or experiment with different architectures as needed.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set. You can find detailed performance metrics in the notebook.
