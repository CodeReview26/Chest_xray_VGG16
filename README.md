## Introduction
Pneumonia is a severe respiratory infection that affects the lungs. Early detection of pneumonia through chest X-ray images is crucial for timely treatment. This project explores the implementation of a machine learning model using the VGG16 architecture to classify chest X-ray images into pneumonia and normal categories.

## Motivation
Early detection of pneumonia can significantly impact patient outcomes and reduce the burden on healthcare systems. This project aims to showcase the potential of machine learning in medical image classification and its relevance in real-world healthcare scenarios.

## Implementation
The project utilizes the VGG16 pre-trained model for transfer learning. The implementation includes data processing, model training, evaluation, and predictions. The code is written in Python and executed in Google Colab.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). It consists of chest X-ray images categorized into pneumonia and normal cases. The dataset is organized into train, test, and validation sets.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chest-xray-classification.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd chest-xray-classification
  

3. Install the required packages using `pip`:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Chest_Xray_Image_Classification.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Follow the code cells sequentially to understand data processing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
3. Modify hyperparameters or experiment with different architectures as needed.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set. You can find detailed performance metrics in the notebook.

## Comparison with Kaggle Project
This implementation is compared with a similar project on Kaggle [link to Kaggle project]. The comparison highlights the similarities and differences in results, providing insights into the effectiveness of this approach.
